## five key points about using Selenium for automated functional testing:

**Functionality Verification:** Ensures the web application works correctly by simulating user actions.

**Software Quality Improvement:** Detects errors before deployment, reducing risks in production.

**Efficiency and Time-Saving:** Enables quick and frequent testing, more efficient than manual testing.

**Consistent and Repeatable Tests:** Provides consistent results, eliminating the variability of manual tests.

**Compatibility and Integration:** Tests across different browsers and systems, and integrates with other development tools.
